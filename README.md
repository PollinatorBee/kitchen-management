# kitchen-management
Responsive web application with user authentication, Firestore database, and Firebase hosting. Developed as an administration platform for my schoolâ€™s cooking classroom to manage dishes and edit client orders (teachers at the school). Designed to work alongside a mobile application for clients to register and place their orders.
